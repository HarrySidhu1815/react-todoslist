            <p>Hi Russell, there is no very specific medical training course for computing students at Georgia Tech, but I found one program in which a student can choose a special topic regarding (Algorithms for Medical Imaging and Inverse Problems). This program is for students who have already completed the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) Georgia Tech offers a Master of Science in Computer Science that can be completed in one out of three options. The option includes a course option that requires a student to complete 30 hours of coursework, a project option that requires a student to complete 21 credit hours of coursework and a 9-credit hour project, and a thesis option that requires the student to complete 18 credit hours of coursework and a 12-credit hour thesis (Master of Science in Computer Science, 2024).

                Also, this course is offered online as well with the name Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). The webpage on the official website of Georgia Tech shows an error due to technical issues but a recently published article on the Georgia Tech website states that the “air officer has earned OMSCS degree while protecting the nation from cyber threats” (Franc, 2023). Therefore, they are offering the online course of this program as well.

                Besides Georgia Tech, University of the Rochester also offers a PhD Training Program on Augmented and Virtual Reality for biomedical engineering, brain and cognitive sciences, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, neuroscience, or optics students (Education, 2024).
